<h2>About</h2>
<p>
My name is Justin, and I am a software developer.
</p>
<p>
I grew up in Vancouver, leaving for Montreal to study Mathematics and Computer Science at McGill University.
Though I now work with the practicalities of software engineering, my time at McGill studying pure mathematics gave me a training in the rigorous standards of proof, logical argumentation, and abstract analysis of the subject, which still find good use daily in my problem solving process.

<p>
Following my graduation from McGill, I returned to Vancouver to work as a software developer.
After a couple years in a developer role, I transitioned to Team Lead and then Team Manager positions.

<p>
I enjoy the challenges and opportunities that come with the ever-changing landscape of software, and exploring how the latest technologies can be combined with proven methodologies to build powerful and effective systems.
</p>
<p>
When not developing software, I enjoy spending time with my lovely wife and children.
